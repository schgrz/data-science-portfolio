## About Me
Hi! 👋 I’m **Alex**, a data enthusiast who loves to solve a puzzle! I enjoy uncovering patterns, building models, and visualizing insights to reveal the story behind the numbers. Whether I'm designing machine learning models, creating reproducible workflows, or streamlining processes through data-driven solutions, every project is an opportunity to solve a problem, improve efficiency, and turn complexity into clarity.

I work across **Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and other visualization tools**, building projects in analytics, reporting, and machine learning.
